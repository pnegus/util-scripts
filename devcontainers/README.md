# devcontainers

This directory contains devcontainer build jobs. This is pretty unnecessary given that you can define all of this in `devcontainer.json` but this was a helpful introduction to containers. 

It builds from <language>_devcontainer to local and cleans old images automatically. It also installs vscode-server to each container.
